Machine Learning techniques are becoming more prevalent in core security technologies like malware detection and network traffic analysis. Its use has opened up new vectors for attacks against non-traditional targets, such as deep learning based image recognition systems used in self driving cars.  There are unique challenges in defending and attacking these machine learning systems that the security community needs to be made aware of.

The AI Villageâ€™s mission is to educate the DEF CON community about the use and abuse of AI in security and privacy. We do this by introducing attendees to the state of the art in attacking and defending AI systems in interactive and non-conventional ways, and dispel popular myths about what AI can and cannot do. We will provide a setting to educate DEF CON at large through engaging contests, workshops, and a platform for researchers in this area to share their latest research.
