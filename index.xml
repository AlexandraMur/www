      <description>The AI Village at DEFCON is a place where experts in AI and security (or both!) can come together to learn and discuss the use, and misuse, of artificial intelligence in traditional security. Artificial Learning techniques are rapidly being deployed in core security technologies like malware detection and network traffic analysis, but their use has also opened up a variety of new attack vectors against the systems that use them.</description>

      <description>With DEF CON just two months away, we&amp;rsquo;re excited to announce two panels that will be held at AI Village this year! Here&amp;rsquo;s what we have planned for attendees so far:
##(Responsible?) Offensive Machine Learning
Panelists @_delta_zero (Moderating) @bodeaceacat @Straithe @filar
Abstract: Cool evil hacks using machine learning are exploding in popularity. Not all ML abuse looks like Terminators, but also DeepFakes, political impersonation, and distracting autonomous cars.
What does &amp;ldquo;Max Evil&amp;rdquo; in machine learning look like, really?</description>

      <title>Dimensionality and Adversarial Examples</title>
      <link>https://aivillage.org/posts/dimensionality-and-adversarial/</link>

      <description>Welcome to AI Villageâ€™s series on adversarial examples. This will focus on image classification attacks as they are simpler to work with and this series is meant to explain the attacks to hackers who have an interest in data science. The underlying principles are the same for attacks against malware/spam/security classifiers, though the implementation varies. This post focuses on the core reason why adversarial examples work, the high dimensional space our data occupies.</description>

      <description>The AI Village is a community of hackers and data scientists working to educate the world on the use and abuse of artificial intelligence in security and privacy.
We are not sponsored by any one company, and it is our mission to maintain it as such as the community grows.
We have a presence at DEF CON, the world&amp;rsquo;s longest running and largest underground hacking conference.</description>
