## Making a post

To make a post please put it in _posts with the following at the top of the file:

```
---
layout: default
category: tutorial
author: Comath
title: Tutorial Test
date: 02-02-2018
---
```

Do not change the layout, it needs to be set to default for Jekyll to find the correct page. Also, the categories currently supported are "post" and "tutorial", more to be added later. Please do put your name, title and post date in. Please put the images in the images folder.

## To-Do

* Split posts into it's own file, instead of using the default
* Add twitter buttons to each page
* Add our logo and strip the rest of the midnight theme artifacts (like the thumbnail)
